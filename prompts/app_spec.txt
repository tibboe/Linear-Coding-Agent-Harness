  <project_name>GameOn - Football Matchmaking Platform</project_name>

  <overview>
    A mobile-first platform that aggregates player interest in football games at specific venues and times,
    then automatically creates games when sufficient interest exists. Players register their availability,
    skill level, and preferred venues. The platform shows real-time demand signals (how many players want
    to play at each venue/time). When thresholds are met, games are created and interested players are
    notified to join the lobby. Supports both open games (anyone can join) and private games (host approval
    required). Focus on football only for MVP to prove the concept.
  </overview>

  <core_concept>
    <interest_driven_matching>
      Traditional sports apps require someone to host a game first, then hope others join.
      This platform flips the model: players declare interest first, and games emerge organically
      when enough people want to play at the same time and place. This solves the "cold start"
      problem by showing demand before commitment.
    </interest_driven_matching>
    
    <demand_visualization>
      Players can see heatmaps of interest: "12 players want to play at Central Park on Saturday 2-4pm".
      This transparency creates social proof and helps players find games that will actually happen.
    </demand_visualization>
  </core_concept>

  <technology_stack>
    <philosophy>
      All services run locally without external API dependencies during development.
      No authentication complexity initially - use demo accounts for testing.
      Mobile-first but web-based for Puppeteer testing compatibility.
      Clean separation between frontend and backend for future scaling.
    </philosophy>

    <frontend>
      <framework>React 18 with TypeScript</framework>
      <build_tool>Vite (fast HMR, excellent DX)</build_tool>
      <routing>React Router v6</routing>
      <styling>Tailwind CSS + Headless UI for accessible components</styling>
      <state_management>Zustand for global state, TanStack Query for server state</state_management>
      <forms>React Hook Form + Zod validation</forms>
      <animations>Framer Motion for fluid mobile interactions</animations>
      <icons>Lucide React (tree-shakeable, consistent)</icons>
      <maps>Leaflet + React Leaflet (no API key required)</maps>
      <mobile_wrapper>Capacitor (future - for app store deployment)</mobile_wrapper>
      <testing>Puppeteer for E2E, Vitest for unit tests</testing>
      <port>5173 (Vite default)</port>
    </frontend>

    <backend>
      <runtime>Node.js 20+ with TypeScript</runtime>
      <framework>Fastify (faster than Express, TypeScript-first, great DX)</framework>
      <database>SQLite with better-sqlite3 (synchronous, zero-config, local)</database>
      <orm>Drizzle ORM (type-safe, lightweight, works great with SQLite)</orm>
      <validation>Zod (shared schemas with frontend)</validation>
      <file_storage>Local filesystem (./uploads directory)</file_storage>
      <realtime>Server-Sent Events (SSE) for notifications</realtime>
      <testing>Vitest for unit/integration tests</testing>
      <port>3000</port>
    </backend>

    <database_choice_rationale>
      SQLite chosen for MVP because:
      - Zero configuration, single file database
      - No Docker or external services needed
      - Instant setup on any machine
      - Surprisingly powerful (handles millions of rows)
      - Easy to inspect with DB Browser for SQLite
      - Drizzle ORM makes migration to Postgres/Supabase trivial later
      - Perfect for solo development and Puppeteer testing
    </database_choice_rationale>

    <future_migration_path>
      When ready for production:
      - Database: SQLite → Supabase PostgreSQL (Drizzle supports both)
      - Auth: Demo users → Supabase Auth
      - Storage: Local files → Supabase Storage
      - Realtime: SSE → Supabase Realtime
      - Mobile: PWA → Capacitor native apps
    </future_migration_path>

    <development_tools>
      <package_manager>pnpm (fast, disk efficient)</package_manager>
      <monorepo>Turborepo (shared types between frontend/backend)</monorepo>
      <code_quality>ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode</code_quality>
      <api_testing>Thunder Client or REST Client VS Code extension</api_testing>
      <db_viewer>DB Browser for SQLite (GUI inspection)</db_viewer>

  <demo_and_testing_system>
    <demo_accounts>
      The system seeds with demo accounts for immediate testing without authentication.
      Demo users are created on first run and can be switched via UI dropdown.

        - demo_venue_admin: "River Park FC" - Venue administrator
        (12+ demo players to simulate realistic interest levels)
      </demo_users>
    </demo_accounts>

    <testing_endpoints>
      GET  /api/demo/current-user            - Get current demo user
      POST /api/demo/switch-user/:userId     - Switch current demo user
      POST /api/demo/reset-database          - Reset to fresh seeded state
      POST /api/demo/simulate-interests      - Add random interests for testing
      POST /api/demo/trigger-game-creation   - Force check for game creation
      GET  /api/demo/users                   - List all demo users
    </testing_endpoints>

    <puppeteer_compatibility>
      - All interactions use standard HTML elements (buttons, inputs, links)
      - Data attributes on key elements: data-testid="interest-button"
      - No external API calls that could fail/timeout
      - Predictable demo data for assertions
      - API supports waiting for SSE notifications
      - Deterministic behavior with seeded data
    </puppeteer_compatibility>
  </demo_and_testing_system>

  <core_features>
    <player_profile>
      <registration>
        - Simple profile: name, avatar (optional), bio
        - Football skill level (1-5 scale with clear descriptions):
          - 1: Complete Beginner (never played organized football)
          - 2: Casual (played occasionally, learning basics)
          - 3: Intermediate (regular player, comfortable with rules)
          - 4: Advanced (competitive experience, skilled)
          - 5: Expert (semi-pro or professional experience)
        - Position preferences (can select multiple):
          - Goalkeeper
          - Defender
          - Midfielder
          - Forward
          - Any/Flexible
        - Play style tags (optional, select up to 3):

        - Reliability indicator (shows up rate)
      </profile_display>
    </player_profile>

    <interest_registration_system>
      <core_concept>
        Players don't commit to games upfront. They register "interest" in playing
        at specific venues during specific time windows. This is a soft commitment
        that says "I'd be interested in a game if one happens here at this time."
      </core_concept>

      <interest_declaration>
        - Select venue from favourites or browse
        - Choose day of week (or specific date)
        - Choose time window (morning/afternoon/evening or specific hours)
        - Set duration preference (1hr, 1.5hr, 2hr)
        - Confirm skill level for this interest
        - Set as recurring (every week) or one-time
        - Optional: preferred game type (casual/competitive)
      </interest_declaration>

      <interest_management>
        - View all my active interests
        - Edit interest details
        - Pause interest temporarily
        - Delete interest
        - See which interests have nearby threshold
        - Get notified when interest becomes a game
      </interest_management>

      <interest_aggregation_display>
        When viewing a venue, players see aggregated interest data:
